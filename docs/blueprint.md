# **App Name**: SmartSchedule

## Core Features:

- Image to Data Conversion: Image analysis tool: Use AI to extract event details (time, date, description) from a timetable image uploaded by the user. This feature analyzes the image to identify and interpret the schedule information.
- Schedule Visualization: Display events in a clear, calendar-like format, allowing users to review and confirm the extracted schedule.
- Calendar Export: Allow users to download the extracted events in a standard format (e.g., iCalendar .ics file).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0C4FF) to convey a sense of calm and organization.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds and neutral elements.
- Accent: Teal (#64CCC9) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean, card-based layout for displaying events.  Prioritize readability and ease of navigation.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for event types (e.g., a calendar icon for dates, a clock icon for times).
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback when the user interacts with the schedule or uploads a new timetable.
